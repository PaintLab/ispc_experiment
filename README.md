Experiment about C# tool chain for IntelÂ® ISPC

see more about ISPC at https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html

Concept:
 
This C# tool chain will ... ( [see the code](https://github.com/PaintLab/ispc_experiment/blob/master/BridgeBuilder/6_Ispc/IspcBuilder.cs) )
 
 
1. this C# toolchain will send **input** .ispc code to  _ispc.exe_ => **output** c-header and object file

2. then the toolchain will read **input** c-header (and parse it)=> **output** c-code binding ("extern C {" code for a new native dll)
   
     AND C# extern code ([DllImport]) for binding with the new dll.   

3. then toolchain  read **input** c-header and autogen code => **output** create .vcxproj project on the fly.

4. the toolchain send **input** .vcxproj  project => **output** native dll 

5. the rest is load that dll, and the C# code will access native func dll from extern code that are generated on step 2
